# ID Badge

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This is a test for an ID badge for my robotics team. It will be used for team member bios, attendance clock in/out, and certification tracking.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Website says about $13 for a minimum order of 5 boards.

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Had to figure out how to export correctly, but the tutorial I followed was very helpful!
